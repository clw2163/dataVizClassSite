    <p>SOHO, TRIBECA, CIVIC CENTER AND LITTLE ITALY | VACANT LOTS</p>
 
    <p>This visualization catalogues vacant lots in lower Manhattan, specifically the neighborhoods of Soho, Tribeca, Civic Center and Little Italy. Each concentric ring, which marks every 1000 SF, represents the size/area of the specific vacant lot, and different colored marks/segments denote their respective types of vacant lands (zoned commercial or Manhattan residential, port authority of NY and NY, New York State & U.S. Government). In terms of visual legibility and quick understanding, major rings lines are highlighted for every 5000 SF, and quantitative information regarding specific lot area is also presented around the edge of the circle. In total, there are 37 vacant lots in this area, ranging from 55 SF- 39,401 SF, most of them being classified as V1 (zoned commercial or Manhattan residential). </p>

    <p>The aim of this graphic was to explore vacant/abandoned lands and their opportunities for growth and urban development. While this information presented potential commercial or ecological value for some, for others, the size of the vacant lot offered an explanation to why the land exists as an urban void. Developing on this initial data, I would like to expand to all neighborhoods in Manhattan and to be able to juxtapose how the number, size and types of vacant lots differ between neighborhoods. Further, it would also be interesting to add the variable of time and to be able to graphically understand how vacant lots have changed or developed in the past few years. </p>
