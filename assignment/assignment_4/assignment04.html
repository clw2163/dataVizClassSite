      <br>THE UNLIKELY ODDS OF MAKING IT BIG aims to trace and investigate the likelihood of success of every artist or band that has played multiple shows in New York between 2013-2016. Success or "making it" is defined as headlining a show of over 3,000 capacity, while venue size (small, medium, large) is used as a proxy for success, as most revenues come from shows. Based on data from Songkick of 3 years and 75,000 shows in New York, the project is divided into three chapters: 1) the odds of making it, 2) how long it takes to make it and 3) everybody else. Using the band Sylvan Esso as a rare example of a band that has made it, the project begins by visualizing the following statistical data: <br>
          <br> + For the 7,000 bands that headlined a small venue in New York in 2013, less than half (3,180) played another show in the next 2-3 years.<br>
          + Of the 3,180 bands that did play again, only 400 headlined a medium venue with a capacity of over 700 people.<br>
          + However, from this last grouping, only 21 out of the original 7,000 bands reached a level of popular success. <br>
      <br>Clearly, the likelihood of "making it" is extremely slim, and the project further illustrates this improbability by individually listing some of the 21 bands that have reached such level of success, as well as when and where. In particular, in the next section, the project outlines each band's trajectory or timeline of success, where the viewer is able to compare the different paths. Here, size of circle indicates venue capacity, while color represents type of show (opened vs. headlined). However, for the most part, bands don't make it, and so the last section accounts for "everybody else," allowing the user to view each concert trajectory for bands that have not (or have not yet) made it. <br>

      <br>In terms of technical data, which was provided by the music event website Songkick, the authors and designers of the project manually defined the different thresholds for each level of success, characterized by venue size or capacity. In the first section, the data is represented in a circular diagram, where each ring reflects a threshold of success while each dot indicates a particular band. As the circle moves inward, the dots increase in size but decrease in number, and thus visually representing the rarity of making it in the music industry through isolation. Because of the sheer number of dots on the perimeter, they are somewhat anonymous or ambiguous, but when 21 of them are individually isolated, they are given importance and presence. Here, there is also this idea of a "parts to a whole" relationship that is implied in both the data itself and in the visualization method, and thus the visualization works well within the context of the data. In the second part of the project, each band's journey to success is represented as a timeline, in which circles on a single horizontal line pinpoint specific moments (shows) that have contributed to the band's success. Although simple, the method is clear and intuitive- time is represented as a linear line. Lastly, in the final section, the data is treated as text, where users can search and view each band's concert trajectory. Listed in alphabetical order and represented graphically in a similar manner as in the previous section, the visualization method successfully considers the substantial size of data, allowing readers to quickly navigate and isolate data they personally find interesting.<br>

      <br>In What is Data Visualization by Lev Manovich (2010), Manovich discusses the two key principles of information visualization: reduction and space. The former describes using "graphical primitives such as points, straight lines, curves and simple geometric shapes to stand in for objects and relations between them," whereas the latter describes using "spatial variables (position, size, shape, and more recently curvature of lines and movement) to represent key differences in the data and reveal important patterns and relations" (Manovich 2010). Here, in the case of this particular data visualization project, the principle of reduction is utilized in the first two sections, in which the summarized data (band or time) is "reduced" or represented to a single dot or line, respectively. Likewise, the principle of space is also illustrated here in that specific spatial variables (position and size) are privileged to reveal trends, patterns and differences in the dataset. In short, the data is neutral and unbiased; it is simply a culturally interesting and relevant project with no clear political or societal implications. <br> 

      <br> Analyzing the data even further, it becomes clear that the scope of the data is geographically narrow. The project focuses specifically on bands that have played in the New York area, failing to account for shows in other major cities. In particular, in the second section, the data visualization of each band's journey of success only depicts concerts in New York. While it may be too complicated or impractical to chart every single show, success is achieved holistically. In other words, it is reasonable to assume that shows in other cities contributed to a band's success, and thus by limiting the scope of the data to only New York, the data is slightly misleading in that success is represented in a linear, single-faceted way. Nevertheless, the project as a data visualization is extremely successful and beautiful. It turns "abstract data into a concrete image [by transforming] data into something that we can perceive and relate to" (Muller 2017). Not only does it graphically express data complexity in a clear and approachable manner, but it also provides a visually aesthetic experience as well. <br>

      <br> In terms of graphic language and layout, the data visualization uses an interactive storytelling format. In other words, as the reader scrolls down the page, the diagrams change, respond and react to correspond with the text, allowing the reader to directly engage with the data. Keywords or important data points are either linked to external sources (i.e. song samples) or highlighted in color to create typographic hierarchy and maintain visual connections between text and graph. However, what makes the project so successful as a data visualization is its interactivity- almost every single part of the visualization is interactive. In the first section, as the viewer scrolls and reads about the unlikely odds of making it in the music industry, the dots in the circular diagram respond to the narrative, becoming larger and decreasing in number as the reader learns about the difficulty of achieving popular success. In a sense, the graphic becomes a visual way of understanding the text, as well as an aesthetic experience.  Further, as readers explore the list of the 21 bands that have made it, a single dot representing that particular band moves to the center, and readers are able to hear samples of the bands' top hits. In the following section, the project utilizes interactive hovering features, where hovering the mouse over any of the circles reveals additional details about the show, including date, venue size and capacity. Correspondingly, this interactive feature is also used in the last section for bands that have not made it, but because of the large dataset, there is an added search tool for easy navigation, which can be sorted by either band or venue. In general, the graphic language and interactivity of the data visualization is extremely successful- in both the web and mobile versions, transitions between sections work seamlessly, and diagrams directly correspond to the text. Here, the advantage and purpose of incorporating such interactivity is that it "expands the physical limits of what [can be shown] in a given space," as well as "making complexity accessible" to the typical average person (Kirk 2016, Tufte 1998). Specifically, through integrating text and data, which Tufte refers to as "data graphics," the interactive hovering features provide "explanations that give access to the richness of the data, [making] graphics more attractive to the viewer" (Tufte 1998). In other words, the interactivity allows for multiple layers and dimensions to the dataset. In short, the data visualization project is successfully well done- not only is it beautifully designed, but it is also approachable, simple and carefully thought out. <br>
