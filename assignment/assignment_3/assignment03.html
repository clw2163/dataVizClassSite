      <h5>VISUALIZING VACANT LOTS IN LOWER MANHATTAN</h5>
      <h6> 
      This visualization catalogues vacant lots of multiple neighborhoods in lower Manhattan from data provided by the PLUTO dataset. The horizontal x-axis and vertical y-axis denote block number and lot area (SF) respectively, while different colored dots represent individual neighborhoods. Here, the area of Hudson Yards, Chelsea, Flatiron and Union Square comprises of the greatest number of vacant lots, of which a large majority are relatively large. On the other hand, there are only 3 vacant lots in the Gramercy neighborhood. </h6> 

      <h6>
      The aim of this graphic was to explore vacant/abandoned lands and their opportunities for growth and urban development. While this information presented potential commercial/economical value for some, for others, the size of the vacant lot offered an explanation to why the land exists as an urban void. For the future, it would be interesting to categorize the different types of vacant lots, providing more information through a potential interactive feature. </h6>
