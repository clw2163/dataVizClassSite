    <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
    <p>Hi! I'm Cynthia and welcome to my website. A little bit about me...I was born and raised in Palo Alto, California, but am currently living in New York. I graduated with a Bachelor of Science in Biology at Duke University and am now an architecture graduate student at Columbia University GSAPP. Here, you will find a collection of my projects as part of my data visualization class.</p>
